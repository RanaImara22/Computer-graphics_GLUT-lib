# Computer Graphics Project

## Description
This project involves creating a 3D scene with various objects and applying color models and transformations using GLUT.

### 3D Scene Objects
1. **Building**
   - At least 2 floors
   - Roof
   - One door
   - Four windows

2. **Bicycle**

## Color Models
- Apply suitable colors to each object in the building.
- Change the background color to green.
- Apply black color to the 3D Bicycle.

## Transformations on the Building
1. Use key 'o' to open the door with a suitable angle.
2. Use key 'c' to close the door with a suitable angle.
3. Use key 'O' to open the windows with a suitable angle.
4. Use key 'C' to close the windows with a suitable angle.

## Transformations on the Bicycle
1. Use key 'f' to move the bicycle forward in the X-axis direction.
2. Use key 'b' to move the bicycle backward in the X-axis direction.
3. Use key 'r' to rotate the right wheel with a suitable angle.
4. Use key 'l' to rotate the left wheel with a suitable angle.

## Circular Motion
- Move the bicycle in a circular street that surrounds the building in an automatic manner.

## Animation Control
- Use the mouse left button to enable animation, making the bicycle rotate around the building.
- Use the mouse right button to disable animation.

## Camera Controls
- Control the camera coordinates to view the 3D scene from different directions, making it look professional.

## Implementation
The project is implemented using GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit). Refer to the provided code for details.
